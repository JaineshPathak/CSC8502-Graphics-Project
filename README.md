# CSC8502 - Elden Ring Theme

The task was to make an fantasy style level in OpenGL and C++. I exported the meshes with animations from Unity to the format accepted by NCLGL library framework.

â€‹The terrain was made in Unity and I exported its heightmap, splatmap and using its heightmap to make the terrain mesh. The splatmap was used for blending different textures with the help of shader.

# Source Code Files to look at
The main sourse code is inside the "Blank Project" folder (sorry for misleading name). The rest of the folder are tutorials provided by University.

# How to Run?
- Make sure in visual studio you are in Debug or Release mode
- Set the Coursework project as the startup project
