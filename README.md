# CSC8502 - Graphics Project

The task was to make an fantasy style level in OpenGL and C++. I exported the meshes with animations from Unity to the format accepted by NCLGL library framework.

â€‹The terrain was made in Unity and I exported its heightmap, splatmap and using its heightmap to make the terrain mesh. The splatmap was used for blending different textures with the help of shader.
